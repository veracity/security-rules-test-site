# Security rules test site
This is a simple site hosted on heroku that implements strict CSP and security rules to see how what is the actual required config for new tracing scripts.

## CSP
CSP configuration should be as strict as possible, that is "self" on all properties. The site should have the best score possible on https://securityheaders.com/
